# How does KNN classifier work?
KNN classifier algorithm works on a very simple principle. Let’s explain briefly in using Figure 1. We have an entire dataset with 2 labels, Class A and Class B. Class A belongs to the yellow data and Class B belongs to the purple data. While predicting, it compares the input (red star) to the entire existing data and checks the similarity between them. What happens when we take k Nearest Neighbors k=3? What happens with k=6? With k=3 — two data points belong to a purple class and one belongs to the yellow class. The majority vote is purple, so the returned predicted output is Class B. But when we have our k nearest neighbors equal to six (k=6), four data points belong to the yellow class and two belong to the purple class. So majority votes are yellow so our predicted label will be Class A. Easy enough right?!!

Maybe these real-world examples will help:

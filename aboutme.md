### My History
My name is Amy Beisel.  I feel as though I have been taken care of my whole life.  This is not a bad thing, as I am very thankful for my family. That said, I am also an extremly hard worker.  I was a profesional mountain biker for 10 years, crowned 2018 Marathon National Champion and x2 fatbike world champion.  Before this I was a vet tech for 10 years.  I have a huge passion for all animals and our environment.     

- I have no background in Computer Science or Data Science, but am extremly excited to learn.  I loved statistics and math while in College studing Biology and Psychology.  
 

## Future Self

I hope to work with a company that shares the same passions as I do.  Misson of helping animals and saving the environment.  I want to be able to take care of myself and I think Data Science with Lambda is my answer.

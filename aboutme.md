---

I am lucky enough to have pursued some of my passions over the course of my career. As a forever-animal lover, I cared
for my patients of all sizes in a small/large animal clinic as a vet tech for nearly 8 years. It's a heartwrenching job that
ultimately led me to another passion - professional mountain biking. It took nearly a decade of dedication and sacrifice to
win a National Title and represent the USA. After being one spot short of the Olympic long team, I decided to reevaluate
my next chapter - Data Science. In college, I enjoyed math and science, especially statistics and genetics. I retired early at
the top of my game to pursue a career in Data Science - currently working 4 part-time jobs and attending school 5 times a
week every evening. In my next decade, I want to combine the skills that I have obtained throughout my life - hard work,
empathy, commitment, and spirit - with my newly-honed expertise in Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Computer
Science. I am also embarking on an entrepreneurship journey as a beekeeper, establishing my brand, High Altitude Hives,
successfully selling out my first harvest! Check out my first data science project about the decline of bee colonies on the Blog page above.
